# Bottle or Cans Classifier Using Deep Learning

This repository contains a project focused on classifying images of bottles and cans using deep learning techniques. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately differentiate between images of bottles and cans, which can be applied in various real-world scenarios, such as recycling systems, inventory management, and automated sorting.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model capable of classifying images as either bottles or cans. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the project aims to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between these two types of objects in images.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project contains images of bottles and cans, which are split into training and testing sets. The images are labeled accordingly to represent the correct class (bottle or can). The dataset can be collected manually, obtained from online sources, or generated using image augmentation techniques.

- **Classes**:
  - Bottles
  - Cans

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bottle-or-cans-classifier.git
cd bottle-or-cans-classifier
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib seaborn
```

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the deep learning model, the following preprocessing steps are applied to the dataset:

1. **Image Resizing**: All images are resized to a fixed dimension (e.g., 128x128) to ensure consistency across the dataset.
2. **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized to a range of 0 to 1 to improve model training.
3. **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.
4. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, typically with an 80-20 split.

## Modeling

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify the images. The model architecture typically includes:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts the image input.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the images using filters/kernels.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Learn complex patterns and make predictions based on the extracted features.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a softmax activation function for binary classification (bottle or can).

The model is compiled with the following settings:

- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy, which is suitable for binary classification tasks.
- **Optimizer**: Adam, a commonly used optimizer for deep learning models.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, used to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly predicted images out of the total predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Metrics to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between bottles and cans.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix that summarizes the performance of the classification model by showing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

## Results

The results section presents the model's performance on the test set, highlighting key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into how well the model can distinguish between bottles and cans.

## Visualization

Visualizations are included to better understand the model's performance and the distribution of the dataset:

- **Sample Images**: Display examples of images from the dataset for both classes (bottles and cans).
- **Training and Validation Loss/Accuracy Curves**: Plots that show how the model's performance evolves during training.
- **Confusion Matrix Heatmap**: A heatmap that visualizes the confusion matrix, making it easier to interpret the classification results.

## Usage

To run the classifier on your dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure that your dataset is in the correct format and location.
3. Run the Python script provided in the repository to train the model and make predictions.

```bash
python bottle_or_cans_classifier.py
```

The script will preprocess the data, train the deep learning model, and display the results, including visualizations.
